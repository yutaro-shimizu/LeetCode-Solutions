|1         |What is the Central Limit Theorem, and why is it important?|The average of a sufficiently large sample will be normally distributed, **regardless** of the original distribution. The mean of the sampling distribution will approximate the mean of the true population distribution. Additionally, the variance of the sampling distribution is a function of both the population variance and the sample size used. N>30.
